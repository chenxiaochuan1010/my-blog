I finally did it! After troubleshooting Node.js versions and configuring GitHub Actions, my personal blog is now live on the internet.

This blog is built with **Docusaurus** and hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**.

## Why I built this
I wanted a place to document my learning journey and store my project notes. Unlike standard blogging platforms, this gives me full control over the code and structure.

## The Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Docusaurus (React-based)
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
* **Deployment:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## What's Next?
I plan to migrate my old posts here and start documenting my new projects.
