It is said on Youtube that all masters program applicant are transferred to IRCC Beijing Office for background verification.

  

The duration of the process differs from person to person. Unfortunately, in my case, it is already over half a year but no result has been provided.

  

May 10th is the last day students may request for a deferral to the next available term. Being struggling thousands times in my mind: 

  

"to cancel my application or to wait?"

  

Finally, I sent out the deferral request to the university. In fact, I have no idea whether I could refund all of my tuition payment and GIC, if the study permit is still in process at the next enrollment of the university.

  

Leave it to God. Trust in Him and His Plan.
